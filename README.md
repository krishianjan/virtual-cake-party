🪄 Project Vision

In a world where most students and professionals live away from their families, Virtual Cake Party is built to bridge that emotional distance. It's more than an app—it's a virtual hug, a celebration room, a cake shared across borders.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  VIP Guest Addition** with emojis and motion
- 👐 AI Hand Gesture Detection** to simulate real-world interactions (like cake cutting)
- 💫  Celebration Effects** like balloons, sparkles, and party icons
- 🌈  Doodle/Cartoon Style UI  with Tailwind CSS & React animations
